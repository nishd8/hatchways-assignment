# Hatchways Frontend Assingment
The project is an exact replica of the document mentioned in the assignment with few variations in styling, I have used Vue.JS for this assignment as it is one of the easier framework as well as most of my experience lies in developing Vue based applications.

**Steps to run the project:**
 - npm install - to install all dependencies
 - npm run serve - to run the application on local host, it automatically chooses the port as 8080
